## Getting Started

* 🔨 Project was built using xcode 9.
* 💳 The validator code is under the validator group. Planning to move this out in the future to its own separate project.
* ☑️ To validate an address, call the Walletvalidator method and pass the 📭 address and 📡 network type (supports prod and testnet).

```
       do {
            try  WalletValidator.validate(address: address, currencyNameOrSymbol: "btc", networkType: .prod)
       } catch {}
```
## Running the tests
